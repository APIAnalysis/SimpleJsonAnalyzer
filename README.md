# SimpleJsonAnalyzer

A simplified version of the JsonAnalyzer. Great for validating local JSON files or when you already have JSON in a string.

## Why?

- Just because something can be deserialized doesn't mean it's right.
- Deserialization failure messages aren't good enough.
- JSON and POCO types have some fundamental differences [de]serialization ignores.
- Because validation rules for a type should be kept with that type, not in a separate location.
